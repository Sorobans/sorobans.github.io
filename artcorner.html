                <h2>Bryce</h2>
                <p> Bryce is a standalone 3D modeling and animation program that was primarily used by hobbyists and
                    freelance 3d artists in the 90's and 2000s (especially rave posters, it seems). The focus of this
                    program is primarily landscape generation and procedural texturing; you can create 'terrain'
                    objects, and edit them using a greyscale height map. There are many different versions, but I
                    primarily use Bryce7, since it runs on Windows 10, and it has a tree generator!<br>
                    <br> By today's standards, Bryce's UI is really strange. You basically don't get any keyboard
                    controls, having to use the strange skeumorphic button schemes to edit your objects. It's pretty
                    difficult to get used to, but the results feel very authentic to 3D renders of the new millenium. If
                    you have 20 bucks to spare, I highly recommend trying Bryce7 out. <br> <br> Images are presented
                    from oldest to newest.

                        alt="I called this one Tropics.bmp. This was me trying to mess with lattices, which are kind of like terrains except they're mirrored, so you can make floating islands and stuff like that.">

                        alt="CrystalInTheLake.bmp. This file was rendered out at a full 1920x1080! ... I literally had to zip the file, split that zip into multiple mini-zips, then save those mini-zips to different floppy disks, just to get it off of the virtual machine. What a pain!">

                        alt="Golf2.bmp. I don't remember why I called it golf2 - It's not like I made multiple golf images. I'd love to remake this in bryce7, now that i'm more experienced with its tree generators. The weird bryce3d trees really take away from it.">

I was struggling with how to keep things looking as crusty as they looked in bryce3D; since Bryce7 is a much newer program, it had 'modern rendering features' - the very things I was trying to avoid. Thankfully, careful use of lighting / dithering / posterizing the final result works wonders.">

                <h2>Character Modelling</h2>
                My favorite thing in the world is making characters, and learning 3D has given me the power to bring
                those character to life and do funny dances.
                <h1> WarpZone Stuff </h1>
                <h2>Wizona</h2>
                Wizona is a 'computer wizard', a game developer who has taken on a strange appearance after being
                isekai'd into an old 90's game development pc.
                Back in the olden days of CableTwo, behind the scenes, we were workshopping a 'cable two mascot' idea. I
                pitched a mascot whose design changed to reflect each show, but carried a signature element - tv
                antennae. The idea for a mascot died out, but I kept the sketch I made of a 'warp zone mascot' and
                turned it into a 'warp zone sona' to use for Halloween. Warp zone-a. Wizona. Get it?
                let's take a look at the progression from the original design to today!
                <div class="gallery">

                <h2>The Netizens</h2>
                Back in college, I had a long string of time where I really wasn't working on any OC's (bad for my
                health). The netizens started off as a project for my advanced portfolio development course and ended up
                becoming a whole new cast of little guys for me to look at. :)

                <br>
                Some of these designs ended up getting pretty heavily tweaked when I went back to them in 2022. A few
                characters have been demoted to side characters, and haven't gotten a remodel yet. The ones that I've
                decided are my favorites are all in the 'World of the Warp' Flash gallery on the main page!

            Motion Graphics! It's like animation, but with TEXT and INFORMATION. I think! I wasn't a very good video
            student.
            <h2> The Network</h2>
            Besides just creating the logo and working with Arby (o7 captain) on the brand design, I also made a few
            schedule bumpers to fit inbetween the reruns. Two of them were used during our first run of the Network.

            Note: I'm currently working on a whole suite of new animations for my streams, but I feel like it'd ruin the
            fun if i put them all here early. So, future nullcasting, remember to update this please

            Cotton [aside from being a CEO] is a lovely streamer who reached out to me for retro-3d overlay assets! I
            tried to base these off of ui element choices from around the XP era. <a
                href="https://www.twitch.tv/cottonwings" target="_blank">Why not check out how it looks in motion? (also
                Cotton is hilarious you should stop by)</a>
